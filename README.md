# Speedy-Q-Learning
This is an implementation of the Speedy Q Learning algorithm on the frozen lake problem instance. 

The code is based on the paper, "Speedy Q-Learning" (Azar, Mohammad Gheshlaghi, et al. "Speedy Q-learning." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2011), which proves a PAC bound on the performance of Speedy Q-learning. 

I have tested the algorithm on both synchronous, asynchronous and epsilon-learning cases. On the frozen lake problem instance, where the objective is to manouver an agent around a frozen lake  which has several holes. The agent fails and returns to the intial state if it falls in one of the holes. 

I also propose and implement a modified version of speedy Q-learning, which is more robust than the conventional speedy Q-learning algorithm. 

Refer to the slides for more information.
